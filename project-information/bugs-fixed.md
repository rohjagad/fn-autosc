# Bugs Fixed

This file records fixes confirmed in source review or live testing.

## `udp-request` SNAT Self-Lockout

- **Commit:** `9ee1bf8`
- Added a higher-priority `RETURN` rule for the VPS management address before
  the broad `10.0.0.0/8` SNAT rule.
- Added `udp-request-fixnet.timer` to reapply the protection periodically.
- Live verification confirmed:

  ```text
  1 RETURN 10.245.234.252 0.0.0.0/0
  2 SNAT   10.0.0.0/8     !10.0.0.0/8 -> <public-ip>
  ```

- VPS internet access remained available while `udp-request` was active.

## `noobzvpns` IPv6 Bind Failure

- **Commit:** `9ee1bf8`
- `installer/noobz.sh` now writes IPv4-only listeners:

  ```text
  local_host = ["0.0.0.0:8080"]
  local_host = ["0.0.0.0:8443"]
  ```

- Live verification showed `noobzvpns.service` active on the IPv4-only VPS.

## Duplicate `fix.sh` Authorization Gate

- **Commit:** `ffc3dd0`
- Decrypted the original shc-wrapped ELF.
- Replaced the runtime `fix/fix.sh` with readable shell source.
- Removed only the separate `rohmatsb-biz/cobaizin` IP check and reboot branch.
- The installer-level authorization check using
  `rohjagad/fn-autosc-auth/izin.txt` remains in place.
- The unmodified decrypted payload is retained at:

  ```text
  fix/fix-decrypted-original.sh
  ```

## Undefined `fix.sh` Sysctl Values

- **Commit:** `ffc3dd0`
- Assigned the values used by the integrated fix:

  ```bash
  NEW_FILE_MAX=1000000
  NF_CONNTRACK_MAX="net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max = 262144"
  NF_CONNTRACK_TIMEOUT="net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_time_wait = 30"
  ```

- Live verification confirmed:

  ```text
  fs.file-max = 1000000
  net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max = 262144
  net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_time_wait = 30
  ```

## NoobzVPN Hosting URL

- Updated the binary URL to the available `noobzvpns.x86-64` asset.
- The corrected binary installed successfully on the Debian 12 VPS.

## Xray Version Drift

- **Commit:** `18660ea`
- Pinned Xray to `25.3.6` instead of resolving a moving version dynamically.
- Live verification reported:

  ```text
  Xray 25.3.6
  ```

## Menu Archive Hosting

- Rebuilt `menu/full.zip` and `menu/lite.zip` with the expected extensionless
  runtime filenames.
- Both archives passed `unzip -t` validation.
- Live installation extracted the menu files into `/usr/bin` successfully.

## Repository-Owned Asset URLs

- Rewired project-owned URLs to the `rohjagad` repositories.
- `bot.zip` now resolves from:

  ```text
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rohjagad/FN-API/main/bot.zip
  ```

- Live HTTP checks returned `200` for the installer, fix script, reference fix
  script, and `bot.zip`.

## Live Installation Verification

- Fresh Debian 12 installation completed successfully with version `1.23`.
- Confirmed active services included Xray, V2Ray, Nginx, HAProxy, NoobzVPN,
  UDP Custom, UDP Request, Dropbear, L2TP, WireGuard, OpenVPN, and FN-OHP.
- Nginx configuration test passed.
- HAProxy configuration validation passed with warnings.

## Not Fixed Yet

The following findings remain open and are documented rather than silently
changed:

- Stale `199.232.68.133 raw.githubusercontent.com` entry.
- SlowDNS failure until a nameserver/domain is configured.
- Fail2ban failure caused by missing SSH log input.
- Libreswan/IPsec crash.
- Duplicate website installation in the Lite installer.
- Reversed IPv4/IPv6 labels in the main menu.
- Full interactive feature coverage for every account action and submenu.
